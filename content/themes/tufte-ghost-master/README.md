# Tufte Ghost
A Ghost theme inspired by Edward Tufte's ideas.

The theme owes it's existence to Davie Liepmann's [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/daveliepmann/tufte-css). Go say thank you to Dave!

##Demo
If you want to see Tufte Ghost in action [go check it out](http://da.vidhallberg.se/tufte-ghost).

##Installation

To download the theme, either clone directly from GitHub through
```
git clone https://github.com/dvdhllbrg/tufte-ghost/tufte-ghost.git
```
or [download the zip](https://github.com/dvdhllbrg/tufte-ghost/archive/master.zip).

After that, the procedure varies depending on your Ghost installation. Ghost for Beginners has [a pretty good guide](https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/how-to-upload-a-theme/) if you're confused.
